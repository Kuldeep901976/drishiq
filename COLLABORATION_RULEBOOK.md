# 🤝 Collaboration Rulebook

## 📋 **Core Principles**

### **1. Permission-Based Changes**
- **NO DELETIONS** without explicit user permission
- **NO REPLACEMENTS** without explicit user permission  
- **NO MAJOR CHANGES** without user approval
- **ALWAYS ASK FIRST** before modifying existing functionality

### **2. Testing Before Confirmation**
- **NEVER confirm** anything without testing it first
- **ALWAYS test** changes in development environment
- **VERIFY functionality** before reporting success
- **SHOW evidence** of testing when confirming

### **3. Real-Time Progress Reporting**
- **For processes > 1 minute:** Provide real-time status updates
- **Progress percentage:** Show completion % at regular intervals
- **Time estimates:** Provide realistic time expectations
- **Status updates:** Keep user informed of current step

## ✅ **Testing Protocol**

### **Before Any Confirmation:**
1. **Test in Development Environment**
   - Run the application locally
   - Verify functionality works
   - Check for errors or warnings
   - Test user interactions

2. **Provide Testing Evidence**
   - Screenshots or descriptions of successful tests
   - Console output showing no errors
   - Confirmation of expected behavior
   - Any limitations or known issues

3. **Document Test Results**
   - What was tested
   - How it was tested
   - Results obtained
   - Any issues found

## 📊 **Progress Reporting Standards**

### **For Long-Running Processes (>1 minute):**

#### **Format:**
```
🔄 [Process Name] - [Current Step]
📊 Progress: [X]% Complete
⏱️  Estimated Time Remaining: [X] minutes
📝 Current Action: [Description of what's happening]
```

#### **Update Frequency:**
- **Every 30 seconds** for processes 1-5 minutes
- **Every minute** for processes 5-15 minutes  
- **Every 2 minutes** for processes 15+ minutes

#### **Progress Indicators:**
- **0-25%:** Initialization/Setup
- **25-50%:** Processing/Execution
- **50-75%:** Validation/Testing
- **75-100%:** Finalization/Completion

   - Provide rollback instructions
   - Suggest alternative approaches
   - Ask for user guidance
   - Wait for user decision

3. **Documentation**
   - Log the error details
   - Note the context
   - Record attempted solutions
   - Prevent future occurrences
